Conclusions:
1. Definite correlation of charter type, small size with higher overall passing rate.
2. Budget per student does not correlate to higher overall passing rate.
3. Between school type there is less varibility in average scores than percent passing, which infers more varibility in district students and less varibility in charter scores.  Student selection could be driver of higher varibility in district scores.
